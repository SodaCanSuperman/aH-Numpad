aHolland's Numpad Build Guide

Parts list
1x 	  Numpad PCB
1x 	  Arduino Pro Micro 
1x 	  24 pin Wide Turned pin IC socket or Standard Wide DIP socket
20x   1n4148 diodes (or anyother fast switching diodes)
20x   Apls or Cherry MX swtiches 
4-18x M3 Standoffs

Optional Parts
3x 2U stabs

17 KEY OR 20 KEY

For 17 keys do not use D8,D16,D17

For 20 keys solder in all diodes

Step 1 - Diodes

Bend all of the diodes to the correct spacing. Put the diodes in the holes and correctly orientate them by refering to the direction shown on the PCB. Once all the diodes are in, solder them in and cut of the legs. Save these as we will need them for the Arduino. 

Step 2 - IC socket (Optional step)

If your IC socket has a middle bridge you will need to remove this as this blocks one of the diodes. Place your IC socket on the PCB and solder it in place. 

Step 3 - Pro Micro 

With Turned pin IC socket - Push 24 of the left over diode legs in the holes. Next put the Pro Micro FACE DOWN to the PCB making sure all of the diode legs go though the holes. After that, solder in all of the pins and trim off the left overs. 

Step 4 - Switches

Push your swtiches flush to the PCB and solder them in. 

Step 5 - Optional - Standoffs/Stabs

Place in the standoffs and stabs for 17 key.
